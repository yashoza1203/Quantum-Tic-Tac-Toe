# Quantum-Tic-Tac-Toe

This game will help you gain knowledge about Quantum principles like Superpostition and entanglement.

## Rules to be followed while playing the game:
### 1. Types of cells 
  Classical cell - Contains X or O in them 
  
  Quantum cell - do not have X or O in them

### 2. Types of moves 
 
** Classical move - ** played on a quantum cell 
 
 
** Quantum move - ** 2 cells should be selected 
 
 a. First cell has to be a quantum cell which will act as a control cell 
 
 b. Second cell has to be a classical cell which will be the target cell
 
 
 Entangle move - After selecting the control and target cell proceed to entangle
