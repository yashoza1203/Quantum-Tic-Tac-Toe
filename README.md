# Quantum-Tic-Tac-Toe

This game will help you gain knowledge about Quantum principles like Superpostition and entanglement.

## Rules:

### 1. Types of cells 
  _Classical cell_ - Contains X or O in them 
  
  _Quantum cell_ - do not have X or O in them

### 2. Types of moves 
_Classical move_ - played on a quantum cell 
 
 
_Quantum move_ -  2 cells should be selected 
 
 ⋅⋅⋅a. First cell has to be a quantum cell which will act as a control cell 

 ⋅⋅⋅b. Second cell has to be a classical cell which will be the target cell
 

 _Entangle move_ - After selecting the control and target cell proceed to entangle
