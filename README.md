### 1. Types of cells 
  _Classical cell_ - Contains X or O in them 
  
  _Quantum cell_ - Does not have X or O in them

### 2. Types of moves 
_Classical move_ - played on a quantum cell 
 
 
_Quantum move_ -  Two cells should be selected 
 
   a. First cell has to be a quantum cell which will act as a control cell 

   b. Second cell has to be a classical cell which will be the target cell
 

 _Entangle move_ - After selecting the control and target cell proceed to entangle
 
 ## Steps to run the game
 1. Clone the GitHub repository or download the code files as a ZIP archive.
 2. Install the required packages by running the following command in the terminal: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
 3. Run the game using the command `python main.py`
